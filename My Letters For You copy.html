	Greetings, darling. I'm here, your beloved wife. Happy 6th Monthsary.
	Time pass so fast isn't? But I will stay right beside you. I'm sorry if
	I'm such a pain to handle. I promise, I'll change. I always try my best
	just to make you happy and you know that. In this past 6 months I had 
	done nothing but to love you fully. I don't know what to do if one day 
	you'll say that you don't feel the same anymore. I'm really sorry for
	everything. Thank you for always understanding me and putting a lot
	of effort just to spend time with me even if you're busy. I appreciate
	that a lot. I appreciate you. I am more than grateful that you existed.
	I cannot wish for more.

		In summer's warmth, my heart did sing
		As love did bloom, my soul did take wing
		The sun did shine, the breeze did sway
		And in each other's eyes, we did stray <br>
		
		Our laughter echoed, our hearts did beat
		As we danced under the starry seat
		The fireflies did twinkle, the crickets did play
		And our love did grow, with each passing day <br>
		
		The world did fade, our love did shine
		As we basked in each other's design
		The warmth of summer, the love we did find
		In each other's arms, our hearts did entwine <br>
		
		The memories we made, the love we did share
		In summer's heat, our hearts did repair
		And as the seasons changed, our love did grow
		In summer's embrace, our hearts did glow. <br>

	For I am offering an apology because it's not a long message
	but this includes my whole love for you.

	I am stretching my arms to offer you my hand, will you hold it?
