	Hi pretty girl. How are you? If you asked about me, I am here.
	Falling and falling for you. It wasn't an easy time when I dreamed
	about of making you mine. But now you are. You're now mine. Like
	nothing belongs to me but my love? */giggles. But what a dream isn't it?
	For sure you have everyone around you who wants to take you. Make them
	'theirs' but oh no, game is over. I finally won. And in about 2 days,
	it will be the 6th month of it. 6th month of me winning over everyone
	but you are not supposed to be labeled as a prize, but my love. 
	A gorgeous person who deserves to feel every bit of love and oh, I'm
	not just going to promise it, I'll make you feel it everyday.
	Thanking everything that somehow lead me to you. If it didn't happened,
	I would probably die without seeing the most beautiful person I've seen.
	</center> </b>
</p>



<p style="font-family: Papyrus"
	<center> <b>
	Oh, what would I do without you. You are the silent shelter in my noisy
	world but at the same time, the wonderful melody washing away my 
	thoughts. You are nothing comparable than my favourite song. Your
	voice is more than enough and even if I have heard all of the
	songs that existed, I would still crawl back to hear you. Atleast your
	breathing or your 'hi's'. 

	I am utterly grateful to have you and I am beyond happiness that
	we fell in love to each other.
	</center> </b>
</p>



<p style="font-family: Papyrus"
	<center> <b>
	For I am offering an apology because it's not a long message
	but oh for sure, you will have another one tomorrow.

	I am stretching my arms to offer you my hand, will you hold it?
