	I am here again, reminding you about
	being the most wonderful person I've met.
	I just hope that you won't get tired
	of my bs. I am genuinely scared of
	losing you. I swear. I hope you know
	that. Sometimes, I'm wondering how
	lucky am I to have you. Did I
	accidentally got a lucky flower?
	Do I have any lucky charms?
	It seems like years passed and I believe
	I am binded with a curse of being so
	unfortunate.
	Fortunately, you walked past by my life
	and hoping for you to never leave.

	A flower for a pretty girl like you.
	Sounds clich√© but I could pick hundreds
	of fresh flowers to give to you.
	I could grow my own field of tulips,
	if it's your favourite one.
	I'll bribe lots of florist for me to
	give you the rarest one in their shop.
	As it symbolises your brightness and
	blooming personality.
	And it symbolises my growing beautiful
	love for you.

	I am sorry if this is not that lengthy.
	It's just for now. You'll have another
	tomorrow.
	But I am placing all my love through
	this. Would you accept it?
	I hope you will.
