	I am here for the second time, showing you what I know about being in love with 
	you. I may not be a perfect person but you know that I always do my best.
	Being in love with you is the best feeling I could ever feel. I hope I spend
	all my tomorrows with you. Thank you for all the days that you made me feel
	loved and appreciated. You are my motivation. The reason and my everything. 
	the on person I would chose at any cost. Every time I see your face and
	hear you voice, I can't help but to fall in love more. You are more meaningful
	than any other arts and songs. Simply a perfection that has ever existed. 
	
	I am out of the words to tell how grateful I am to have you.

	I have vouyage on all the sea and will travel around the galaxy. But no one else
	is more beautiful than you. You have brought so much light on my days than the
	moon and the sun up above us. I don't know what to do without you. You are beyond
	any measure. You have accepted every inch of me and thank you for that. I will
	love you until the stars no longer shines. 'Till dusk and dawn, I will be by your
	side.

	I am out of the words to tell how grateful I am to have you.

	I am sorry if this is not that lengthy.
	It's just for now. You'll have another
	tomorrow.
	But I am placing all my love through
	this. Would you accept it?
	I hope you will.
